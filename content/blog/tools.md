The following are some of the resources I have been using to learning programming, CS and stuff in general. There is no order here, just the resources and my comments.

## **YouTube Channels**

- [MIT OCW]() & [Stanford Online]()  
    Essentially replacements for my university courses which are not of high standards
- [Steve Brunton]()   
    Love the videos on probability, rl and control theory
- [The Cherno]()  
    Amazing videos on C, Graphics Programming and Game Engine content
- [Two Minute Papers]()  
    "What a time to be alive - with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér"
- [Welch Labs]()  
    Another amazing channel on LLMs and Deep Learning
- [Ritvik Math]()  
    Lots of good data science explainers
- [3Blue1Brown]()  
    3B1B is one of the best math youtube channels, especially the linear algebra, calculus introductions and the work with Khan Academy
- [Mathemaniac]()   
    Really good animated math videos, similar to 3B1B
- [Sebastian Lague]()  
    One of my major inspirations for programming initially, and also really cool coding adventure videos
- [Ben Eater]()  
    One of best channels in electronics engineering
- [Anton Petrov]()  
    Great explainers on recent science, math and STEM topics 
- [Artem Kirsanov]()  
    Videos on computational neuroscience. Particularly like the videos where ML is connected to biological learning
- [Khan Academy]()  
    The resource I use for learning almost any new foundational concept first.
- [diinki]()  
    Arch linux and linux content
- [Fireship]()  
    Some of his 100s vids have taught me more than my uni
- [freeCodeCamp]()  
    A lot of good content on almost any concept in programming

## **Books**

- [Mathematics for Machine Learning]()  
    A great book covering fundamental mathematics as well as machine learning methods in a more igourous format.
- [Sheldon Axler]()  
    Standard text for linear algebra
- [Sutton & Barto]()  
    A great book to start learning reinforcement learning

These are ofcourse not the only books I have read. I also read biographies, finance & investing books, dark fiction, manga

## **Paid Resources**

I generally do not like to pay for education since it is quite freely available on the internet but sometimes having a structured syllabus feels nice and motivating

- [CS50AI on HarvardX]()  
    Short but great course on AI concepts, algorithms and such, with projects and quizzes in each.

- [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specializations]()  
    Longer but more comprehensive course with practical labs, quizzes, etc that cover the fundamentals for most of machine learning - nns, decision trees & ensembles, recommender systems, rl, anomaly detection and clustering, etc

- [Whartons Business Foundations Specialization]()  
    A comprehensive course that covers marketing, accounting, and a bunch more related to business

Other than these, I have read some foundational research papers in ml and rl

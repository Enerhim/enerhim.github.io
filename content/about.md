Hi, I am an undergrad ML engineer into machine learning  and currently into deep reinforcement learning. I wrote my first shell script when I was 11 and made small games in Gamemaker and Unity. My interest gradually shifted to linux (I use Arch BTW) and now machine learning. 

Other than technical stuff, I am into philosophy, anime (favourites being Orb, Frieren & Vinland) and writing short fanfictions for myself.
